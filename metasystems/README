This directory contains original and patched versions of the highlander library, version 0.9.91.

The patch addresses two issues:

1. The sendfile on Mac OS is incompatible with the one used in highlander.

2. The request handler was modified to allow the default page handler to 
   serve pages determined at runtime while still allowing unhandled requests
   to fall through to the error handler. This allows us to write a default
   page handler that uses Nu to test requests and generate responses.

Build and install the patched version with:
	./configure
	make
	sudo make install
